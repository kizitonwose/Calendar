- [x] Custom calendar view/composable - Make your calendar look however you want, with whatever
  functionality you want.
- [x] Custom first day of the week - Use any day as the first day of the week.
- [x] Horizontal or vertical scrolling calendar.
- [x] HeatMap calendar - Suitable for showing how data changes over time, like GitHub's contribution

  library provides the logic, you provide the views/composables.

## Sample project

It's important to check out the sample app. There are lots of examples provided for both view and compose implementations. 
Most techniques that you would want to implement are already done in the examples.

Download the sample
app [here](https://github.com/kizitonwose/Calendar/releases/download/2.0.0/sample.apk)

## Setup

The library uses `java.time` classes via [Java 8+ API desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring) for backward compatibility since these classes were added in Java 8.

#### Step 1

This step is required ONLY if your app's `minSdkVersion` is below 26. Jump to [step 2](#step-2) if this does not apply to you.

To set up your project for desugaring, you need to first ensure that you are using [Android Gradle plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-plugin) 4.0.0 or higher.

Then include the following in your app's build.gradle file:

```groovy
android {
  defaultConfig {
    // Required ONLY if your minSdkVersion is below 21
    multiDexEnabled true
  }

  compileOptions {
    // Enable support for the new language APIs
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    // Set compatibility to Java 8 (can be higher if desired)
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }

  kotlinOptions {
    // Also add this for Kotlin projects
    jvmTarget = "1.8"
  }
}

dependencies {
  coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:<latest-version>'
}
```

You can find the latest version of `desugar_jdk_libs` [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.android.tools/desugar_jdk_libs).

#### Step 2

Add the desired calendar library (view or compose) to your app `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  // The view calendar implementation
  implementation 'com.kizitonwose.calendar:view:<latest-version>'

  // The compose calendar implementation
  implementation 'com.kizitonwose.calendar:compose:<latest-version>'
}
```

You can find the latest version of the library on the maven central badge above.

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatypeâ€™s snapshots repository](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/kizitonwose/calendar/).

**Note: If you're upgrading from version 1.x.x to 2.x.x, see the [migration guide](https://github.com/kizitonwose/calendar/blob/main/docs/MigrationGuide.md).**
